# clj-flickr-memories

This is a port of https://github.com/emanchado/Flickr-Memories,
written mainly to learn a bit more Clojure, and to experiment a bit
more with RoboHydra 0.4 in a real setting.


## Installation

First, make sure you have JDK and Leiningen installed. Then, clone
this repo.


## Usage

You can call clj-flickr-memories from inside the repo directory like:

    lein run <Flickr-URL-name> <date-from> <date-to>

Where the Flickr URL name is the bit after `http://flickr.com/photos/`
in your photo stream URL.
